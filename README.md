# Dijkstra's Algorithm

* MA 6
* CPTS 223

> For this micro assignment, you must implement the function that implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm inside Graph.h. There are a simple set of 4 tests that will output the expected distances once you implement the algorithm in Graph.h.

# Grading
> Your submission will be graded based on the following:

* [10] Your solution builds, does not cause any runtime issues, and passes all test cases
